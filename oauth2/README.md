# oauth2

[OAuth2](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) module of [disgo](https://github.com/DisgoOrg/disgo)

## Getting Started

OAuth2 can be used to authenticate users with Discord on your website. 
For this to work, you need to create an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and get the client ID and secret.
Next you need to put in your redirect URL.

### Usage

See [here](https://github.com/DisgoOrg/disgo/blob/development/_examples/oauth2/example.go) for an example.
