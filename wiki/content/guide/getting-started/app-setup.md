## Creating a Discord Application

You've installed Go & DisGo. You're now ready to code that awesome discord bot! _is what i'd like to say_ <br>

But before you can code a bot, you need to create a Discord Application (i.e. **Discord Bot**)

Here's how to create one

{{% steps %}}

### Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

![](/images/getting-started/discord_applications_dashboard.png)

### Click on "New Application"

### Give your new shiny application a name

You should now end up in this page.

## The Bot Token

{{< callout type="error" emoji="‼️">}}
**This section is very important** as the Bot Token is essentially the Bot's password
{{< /callout >}}

Head to the "Bot" section on the sidebar on the left
![](/images/getting-started/bot_section.png)

Scroll down until you see "Token"
![](/images/getting-started/bot-token.png)

You'll need to reset the token to view it, and when you do, copy it somewhere safe and by all means **DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE THAT YOU DON'T TRUST!**

If you think your bot token has been leaked (i.e. a compromised token), immediately go to this page and reset it again

## Congratulations

Now you're a proud owner of a shiny new discord bot. Sadly, it's still living at Discord's place and is not in any server. But we'll get to that next!
