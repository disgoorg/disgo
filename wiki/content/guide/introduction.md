So you want to make a discord bot using go programming language?<br>
**You've come to the right place!**

But before we start making the next million dollar discord bot, we'll need to learn a few things
Including, but not limited to:

<!-- TODO links to all the pages -->

- How to create a [Discord Developer Account & Creating a bot](/guide/getting-started/app-setup)
- How to scaffold a [DisGo project](/guide/disgo-bot/setting-up-your-bot/project-setup)
- Dealing with common Discord API (e.g [components](), [reactions](), [embeds]())
- And much much more

## Before you start...

Now, some prerequisites. Making a bot is very cool, and could earn you some bragging points. But in order to create a very awesome bot using DisGo, a good grasp of the Go programming language will go a long way. **Technically**, you can create a discord bot with minimal Go knowledge, but you'll likely run into issues and be frustrated when you get stuck on what should have been an easy problem.

If you'd like to learn the Go programming language, here are a few resources that could help you

- [A tour of the Go programming language](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
- [Writing Effective & Idiomatic Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- [A collection of examples for common topics & patterns of Go](https://gobyexample.com)
- [The complete Documentations of the Go programming language](https://go.dev/doc/)

These resources will help you immensely on your Go journey, and will also help you make that new million-dollar discord bot idea you have
